/* Write a function called superbowlWin() in index.js:

The function should receive 1 argument, an Array of JavaScript Objects
Each object has two properties: year and result
It should use find() to test each Object to see if the result is "W" â€” a win!
It should return the year when the win occurred (if it occurred at all!)
If no win is found, it should return, sadly, undefined */


function superbowlWin(record) {
    const found = record.find((game) => { // Use the find method on the record array
      return game.result === "W"; // Check if the game result is "W"
    });
    if (found) {
      return found.year;
    }
    return undefined;
  }
